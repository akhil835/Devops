What is Service?

In the context of Kubernetes, a service is a way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. 
Kubernetes Services come in several types, each serving a different purpose

Different types of services

1.ClusterIp Service

2.Node Port Service

3.Load Balancer Service
etc

1.ClusterIP Service: This is the default type of service in Kubernetes. It gives a service an internal IP address so it can be accessed within the cluster. 
This type of service is useful when you want to expose a service within the cluster only.

Here's a basic example of a ClusterIP service in YAML

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376

2.NodePort Service: This type of service exposes a service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A NodePort service can be accessed externally through <NodeIP>:<NodePort>. 
It's a way to expose the service outside the cluster.

Example of a NodePort service in YAML:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
      nodePort: 30007

3.LoadBalancer Service: This service type exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. 
It assigns the service a public IP address so that it can be accessed from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

Example of a LoadBalancer service in YAML

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376


Each of these service types plays a crucial role in application deployment and accessibility in a Kubernetes environment. 
They enable different ways to manage and expose applications running on clusters.
